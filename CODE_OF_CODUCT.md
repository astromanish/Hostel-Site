# Self made Rules

This file contains some self made rules which one must follow. Though without following this rules site will work completely fine. But keeping in mind future extension of site and more than contributers this rules become kinda necessary to follow.

## Files/Folders Naming Conventions

1. All file name should be in small letter with each words separated by dash.
2. All pathname to Link should also be in small letter with word separated by dash.
3. All folder name have also all letters small except first letter of each word capital and no dash in between words.
4. In file name or pathname to Link try to write complete name until unless you have a abbreviation which is self explanatory.
5. All css file of every component must have same name as component.

## File Organization

1. Outside components folder only ("index.js","app.js","app.css") need to be kept.
2. All main component for each page on site need to be kept in folder pages.
3. All branching out components for any page on site need to be kept in a separate folder in componets folder.

## Design/Styling

1. All general styling are kept in and need to be kept in "app.css".
2. And any page specific styling kept in their separate css file.

`Quick Tip: Try to keep most styling as general (I mean just try xD) `
