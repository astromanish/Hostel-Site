            The joy and liveliness of
            creating new things from scratch is the point of unification of all
            the clubs of the Film and Media Council.

          Weekend is a celebration of creativity. It is an opportunity for
          everyone to try their hands on especially tailored events that brings
          out creativity from within you. In FMC Weekend ’15, there were
          competitions encompassing the areas of photography, cinematography,
          animation, entertainment, media and design all of which were based on
          the theme
          <span>‘The Superhero Fiesta’.</span>

          On one hand, events like <span>Selfie, 3-Draw, VFX</span> and the
          design events tested the participants for their skills in the
          respective fields whereas on the other hand, events like{" "}
          <span>Superdub, Snapchase</span> and <span>Ad-o-Mania</span> examined
          their creativity, thinking and ability to work as a team. Events like{" "}
          <span>RJ Hunt</span> and <span>Brainstorm</span> allowed participants
          to exhibit their presentation skills and showed the judges how good
          thinkers they are. There were also fun events like the{" "}
          <span>Bollywood Quiz</span> and <span>Superhero Quiz</span> in which
          the so-called ‘old-fashioned’ culture of quizzing was blended with the
          enjoyment of movies and comics.

          Another unique attraction of the Weekend was the camera exhibition in
          which 14 archaic cameras, with a few being from the 1900s as well,
          were kept for the participants to see and know more about. All the 3
          days of the event culminated with screening of 2 blockbuster Hollywood
          movies under the starlit sky on a gigantic screen.

          Perhaps the most attractive session was the panel discussion with
          eminent personalities from the fields of films, philosophy, literature
          and politics to debate upon the role and types of culture. The panel
          included Mr. Praveen Kumar Chaturvedi, the CEO of Moonlight Pictures
          and Mr. Markanday Katju amongst others.

          Finally, the fest culminated successfully and really left an indelible
          mark on everyone’s mind, relieving much of the stress and tension in
          it saying out loud “Why so serious ???!!!”
