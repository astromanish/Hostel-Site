              <p>
                At the end of each semester/term, a student is awarded a letter grade in

                learning based on performance in the various examinations, quizzes,
                assignment/term paper, laboratory/project work(if any), etc. A relative
                system of grade is used, and it reflects the level of learning by a
                student.

              Attendance
            </h1>
              <p>
                Attendance of students in lectures, tutorials, practical and project
                work is important for the learing process. Participation of students in
                the different class room, curricular and co-cullicular, and other
                activities facilitates an interactive process of learning, making the
                attendance a very component of the Academic Programme. It also helps to
                bring discipline in the students's life, thus enhances the overall
                personal devlopment of the students.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is expected that the students would attend all the classes. However,
                it is noted that sometimes, due to some exigencies, the student might
                have to miss some classes. For a student who has an absense above 25% in
                a course, whatever may be the reason for a shortfall in attendance,
                his/her registration in the course will stand cancelled. A student is
                required to be responsible to keep track of his attendence during the
                semester continuously. The absense of 25% will be calculated as the
                absolute number, rounded to next higher integer of the actual classes
                held in a course.
